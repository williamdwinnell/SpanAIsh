# SpanAI
An English to Spanish translator with a focus on education.
- SpanAI is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that uses the OpenAI GPT-3 model to translate English sentences to Spanish and provide a Spanish lesson about the translation. 
- There is also a Socratic Chat system that attempts to teach spanish concepts in a more natural way using GPT-4. 
- We also present a 2.4M parameter sentence autocompletion model for spanish, designed to help spanish learners right more effectively.
